        Hi <span className="wave">👋</span>
        <br></br>My name is Hugo Holm
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've always had a big interest in UI/UX-design and I usually spend a lot
        of my spare time on web development (full stack). On this website I'll
        showcase some of my skills and projects so have a look around!
        <span className="currently">
          I'm currently on a break from studying Computer Science and
          Engineering at KTH in Stockholm, and am therefore available for hire.
        </span>
      </p>
